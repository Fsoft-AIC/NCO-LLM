The `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix and returns prior indicators of how bad it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input. The heuristics should contain negative values for undesirable edges and positive values for promising ones. The
task can be solved by extracting global and local features (can be latent features) from the distance matrix of nodes and return a heuristic matrix.
